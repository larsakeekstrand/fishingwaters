# BDD Migration Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. BDD Framework Setup

- Installed Cucumber.js with TypeScript support
- Configured test environment with JSDOM for React component testing
- Added npm scripts: `test:bdd` and `test:bdd:watch`

### 2. Feature Files Created

- **map-display.feature**: Map rendering and species filtering scenarios
- **side-panel.feature**: Information panel display and interaction
- **species-filter.feature**: Fish species selection functionality
- **data-loading.feature**: Data loading and error handling

### 3. Step Definitions Implemented

- TypeScript step definitions for all feature scenarios
- Integration with React Testing Library
- Shared test state via Cucumber World object

### 4. BDD Test Structure

```text
features/
├── *.feature              # Gherkin scenarios
├── step-definitions/       # Step implementations
│   ├── map-display.steps.ts
│   ├── side-panel.steps.ts
│   ├── species-filter.steps.ts
│   ├── data-loading.steps.ts
│   └── common.steps.ts
└── support/               # Test setup
    ├── world.ts          # Custom World class
    ├── hooks.ts          # Before/After hooks
    └── setup.ts          # Environment setup
```

### 5. Integration with Existing Tests

- Created example BDD-aligned unit test (Map.bdd.test.tsx)
- Existing Jest tests continue to work alongside BDD tests
- Both testing approaches can coexist

## How to Use

### Run BDD Tests

```bash
# Run all scenarios
npm run test:bdd

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:bdd:watch

# Run specific feature
npm run test:bdd features/map-display.feature

# Dry run (check steps without execution)
npm run test:bdd -- --dry-run
```

### Write New Features

1. Create `.feature` file with Gherkin scenarios
2. Run tests to see undefined steps
3. Implement step definitions
4. Iterate until all scenarios pass

### Benefits

- Clear user-focused specifications
- Living documentation
- Shared understanding between developers and stakeholders
- Test scenarios drive development
- Regression protection with behavior verification

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run test:bdd` to execute all scenarios
2. Fix any failing tests by adjusting step implementations
3. Add more scenarios as new features are developed
4. Integrate BDD tests into CI/CD pipeline
5. Use feature files in sprint planning and acceptance criteria
